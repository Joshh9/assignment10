    <section>
      <h2>The Llama</h2>
      <p>The Llama loves anything organized. Whenever she sees a list, she walks over calmly and inspects each item with care, as if evaluating its usefulness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
      <p>The Anaconda is fast and sneaky. He uses anchor tags to silently move through the page without being noticed until it’s too late.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Advanced HTML Animals</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Llama</dt>
        <dd>A tall, furry animal with a serious stare. Known for its love of structure and dislike of cluttered layouts.</dd>

        <dt>Anaconda</dt>
        <dd>A long, quiet snake that uses hyperlinks to move quickly and silently between sections of the page.</dd>

        <dt>Hippopotamus</dt>
        <dd>Large and mysterious. No one’s really sure what he does, but he’s definitely part of the group.</dd>
      </dl>

    <section>
      <h2>Emphasis and importance</h2>
      <p>
        Two things that matter a lot to me are <strong>consistency</strong> and <strong>progress</strong>.
        I try to stay focused on small wins every day because even if things feel slow, <em>moving forward still counts</em>.
